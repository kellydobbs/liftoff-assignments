## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)


### Overview
We are creating a database of recipes that are specific to the St. Louis region. This project is for Local St. Louis recipes or famous St. Louis Restaurant recipes. This app will assist with recreating the recipes to perfection. Users will be able to create profiles, save and organize recipes, create a weekly meal plan, search by particular categories (course, protein, veg), add comments and reviews, create a shopping list, create a favorite's list. This will also include a feature that will enable the user to create a weekly meal plan.

St. Louisans are spread out across the world, and miss the taste of home. This application will be available for St. Louis expats and for anyone interested in the cuisine of the St. Louis region. With the COVID-19 crisis, many people are unable to order take out due to health concerns, so this will bring the recipes and a taste of normalcy to their home. This application will act as a central location of the existing recipes from St. Louis. It will allow the user to view/search recipes that are native to St Louis and St Louis Restaurants, and preserve St. Louis recipes that would otherwise be lost.
